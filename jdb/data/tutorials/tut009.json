	"content": "<p>A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.</p><p>Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralised services instead.</p><p>Many people and organisations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resources—but more volunteers are needed to allow Bitcoin based crypto coin to continue to grow.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node</a><br>Changed in text: \"Bitcoin\" to \"Bitcoin based crypto coin\"</p>"
